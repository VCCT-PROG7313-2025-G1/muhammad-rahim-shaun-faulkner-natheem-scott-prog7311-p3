# POE PART 3

# Corrections Made to POE Part 2 

Please note the issues that were corrected from the feedback given back to us from PART 2 was all done before part 3 features were implemented and the feedback we received were as follows:

‚Ä¢	Users should require to optionally take an in-app photo

‚Ä¢	Users should be able to view the image receipt attached to transactions.

‚Ä¢	The main layout pushes up into the status bar of the emulator. Layout discrepancies in a few components.

# Two Innovative features that were added

‚Ä¢	**Feature 1: (User bank accounts)** - Added functionality for user to create bank accounts with account type and that also stores balances to be used for the app. This is tied to the user and any transaction made by the user will be attached to the account they choose, in turn adding to the accounts balance.

‚Ä¢	**Feature 2: (Export to CSV) -** Added functionality to export analytical data to a CSV file per month which can be used by the user to add to an excel sheet.

# Android App Project

We created a mobile Android application that was made to track and manage the users spending across different categories. The app also includes the improved UI elements based on our lecturers feedback and now we have implemented features such as visual spending analysis with the use of graphs. Users are now able to view category expenses over a selected period of time. We also included how their spending aligns with a defined minimum and maximum goals. The platform also connects to an online database using Firebase for data storage and it retrieves all the records in real time in order to support a smooth and responsive user experience.
